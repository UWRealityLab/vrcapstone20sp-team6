                    <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

                    <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p> -->

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Learning Unity</h2>             <!-- first topic headding -->

                    <p>The project has started off right where it should, with a healthy amount of Unity tutorials. Our team members are fairly new to Unity and to get things rolling we started with a tutorial called RollaBall, giving us exposure to fundamental unity API functions for working with game objects within the editor.</p>

                    </a>

                    <p>After having fun creating our first game in unity we learned how to set up a scene in the editor for various VR/AR platforms via Unity's asset store.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Taking the Leap</h2>

                    <p>The entire team was excited to hear that everyone in the capstone would receive a Magic Leap One to test the capabilities of remote AR collaboration during the pandemic quarantine. It is amazing to have the opportunity to experiment with this technology and potentially incorporate it into our projects.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Embarking on our Quest</h2>

                    <p>Exploring the Oculus Quest is another first for the team. The mobility and accessibility of the Quest is of great interest to the group and we are excited to how we can use this innovative new frontier of wireless VR in our project.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Wind in the Sails</h2>

                    <p>Brainstorming ideas for our project's focus was more difficult than we anticipated having both VR and AR headsets at our disposal. During the initial discussions, it was clear that we wanted to create an application that would allow users to be social with one another and use the XR technologies to bridge the isolation everyone is facing.</p>
                    <p>During our discussions we discovered a common interest for the outdoors and we are fortunate to live in an area with many beautiful natural features. From the inspiration of the Puget Sound, Hands on Deck, a VR sailing experience, was born.</p>
                    <p>Team 6 is very excited to be taking on this project and welcomes you to follow us on our development through these blog posts.</p>
