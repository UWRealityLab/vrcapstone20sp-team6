                    <p>We created our project pitch video and presented the idea to our peers. While creating the pitch outline we considered the level of detail we wanted to deliver. With the feedback of our peers and course staff, our team was able to paint a clearer picture of what could be accomplished for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP):</p>

                    <q>A scene capable of holding 2-4 players featuring a boat with functioning sails, anchor, and helm that displays the point of sail concept.</q>

                    <br>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/points.gif" alt="a diagram outlining the concept of points of sail, with boats pointing in each direction">
                    </a>

                    <p>A diagram of the point of sail is above, outlining the mechanic of maintaining the direction of a craft in relation to the wind by directing the sail accordingly. Additionally, we will have the baseline aesthetic and lighting for the low-poly art style featuring convincing water with a few placeholder islands as landmarks to gauge the sailing mechanics.</p>

                    <p>For more information about our project, please check out the pitch video is available on the home page of our website along with the Product Requirements Document.</p>

                    <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Asset Management</h2> 

                    <p>A major decision for the team was to focus on the multiplayer features, UI system to communicate effectivly with players, and the player interactions themselves. This decision has lead the team to offset as much as the assest production as possible. While we believe that we could build most of the modeling assests out, collecting what assests we can purchase and then modify for our means will ensure a more polished product on the development pillers we established.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pulling out of the Docks</h2>

                    <!-- <p>Now with a roadmap in front of us, team 6 is prototyping the multiplayer features and the player interactions. Once we are satisfied we will focus on the UI and produce the ship and water assests as we work towards our MVP goals.</p>-->
                    <p>With the Project Requirements Document complete, we now had a roadmap in front of us. We will be hard at work doing research and starting on a barebones prototype for our MVP.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Wind in the sails</h2>

                    <p>Brainstorming ideas for our project's focus was more difficult than we anticipated having both VR and AR headsets at our disposal. During the initial discussions, it was clear that we wanted to create an application that would allow users to be social with one anther and use the XR technologies to bridge the isolation that now effects everyone.</p>
                    <p>During our discussions we discovered a common liking for the outdoors and we are fortunate to live in an area with many beautiful natural features. From the inspiration of the Puget Sound, Hands on Deck was born.</p>
                    <p>Team 6 is very excited to be taking on this project and what we can accomplish with it.</p>
