                    <p>The team created our projct pitch video and presented to the idea to our peers. While creating the pitch outline we navigated the levels of details we wanted to deliver our team discoved numerous ideas that we organinze to fit the scope of our project and settling on the team's Minimum Viable Product (MVP).</p>

                    <p>Team 6 is dedicatd to deliver a scene capable of holding 2-4 players featuring a boat with functioning sails, anchor, and helm that displays the point of sail concept as our MVP.</p>

                    </a>

                    <p>A diagram of the point of sail is above, outlining the mechanic of maintaining the direction of a craft in relation to the wind by directing the sail accordinginly. Additionally, we will have the baseline asthetic and lighting for the low-poly art style featuting convincing water with a few placeholder islands as landmarks to guage the sailing mechanics.</p>

                    <p>The pitch video is available on the front page along with the Product Requirements Document that contains more details.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Asset Management</h2>

                    <p>A major decision for the team was to focus on the multiplayer features, UI system to communicate effectivly with players, and the player interactions themselves. This decision has lead the team to offset as much as the assest production as possible. While we believe that we could build most of the modeling assests out, collecting what assests we can purchase and then modify for our means will ensure a more polished product on the development pillers we established.</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/magic_leap_unbox.jpg" alt="">
                    </a> -->

                    <h2 class="section-heading">"Perpare to make way"</h2>

                    <p>Now with a roadmap in front of us, team 6 is prototyping the multiplayer features and the player interactions. Once we are satisfied we will focus on the UI and produce the ship and water assests as we work towards our MVP goals.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Wind in the sails</h2>

                    <p>Brainstorming ideas for our project's focus was more difficult than we anticipated having both VR and AR headsets at our disposal. During the initial discussions, it was clear that we wanted to create an application that would allow users to be social with one anther and use the XR technologies to bridge the isolation that now effects everyone.</p>
                    <p>During our discussions we discovered a common liking for the outdoors and we are fortunate to live in an area with many beautiful natural features. From the inspiration of the Puget Sound, Hands on Deck was born.</p>
                    <p>Team 6 is very excited to be taking on this project and what we can accomplish with it.</p>
